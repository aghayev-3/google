# Creating a folder

## For keyboard-only users:

* Navigate to the desktop using the **Tab** key and **arrow** keys.

* Press **Ctrl + Shift + N** to create a new folder.

* The new folder will be named **New Folder** by default.

* Rename the folder with **My Super Cool Folder** and press **Enter**.

## For other users:

* **Right-click** anywhere on the desktop and you should see a menu appear
* Hover your cursor over **New** and another menu should appear 
* Move your cursor to the first option (**Folder**), and select it
* A new folder called **New folder** will appear by default, and the text should already be highlighted for you to edit.
* If you click anywhere before changing the name, you'll need to right-click the folder and select the **Rename**  option to be able to edit it.
* Change the name to **My Super Cool Folder**.

## Done :)
* Your folder has been created and named! 
* To verify, **double-click** on the folder and a **Windows Explorer** window should pop up, showing you the contents of your currently empty folder.
